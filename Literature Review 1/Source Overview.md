# “Quanvolutional Neural Networks: Powering Image Recognition with Quantum Circuits”

by Maxwell Henderson,  Samriddhi Shaky, Shashindra Pradhan,  and Tristan Cook

## Basic Information

**Dataset:** MNIST dataset (70,000 28x28 greyscale pixel images.)

**Methodology:**
1. Split data 60,000/10,000 for training/testing
2. Define QNN filter
3. Encode and decode
4. Implement CNN, QNN, and Random model

**Limitations:**
- QNN Limitations (e.g., large # of transformations)
- “a massive number of practical questions need further research to bring the QNN functionality to its peak performance”

**Results:**
